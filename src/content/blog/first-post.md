# The 5 minute rule

If you’ve ever procrastinated on something important — writing, working out, cleaning, learning a new skill — you’re not lazy. You’re human.

One of the simplest productivity ideas I’ve come across is the 5 minute rule.

It’s deceptively simple, but incredibly powerful when applied consistently.

The rule is this:

> Commit to doing a task for just five minutes. That’s it.

Not forever.
Not “until it’s done.”
Just five minutes.

If after five minutes you want to stop, you’re allowed to stop — guilt-free.

The magic isn’t in the five minutes themselves.
It’s in what happens after you start.

Why the 5-Minute Rule Works

1. Starting Is the Hardest Part

Most tasks don’t feel hard once you’re doing them.
They feel hard before you start.

Your brain exaggerates:

The effort required

The time commitment

The emotional cost

Five minutes feels safe. Non-threatening. Manageable.

2. It Bypasses Motivation

The 5-Minute Rule doesn’t rely on motivation.
It relies on momentum.

Once you start:

Friction drops

Focus increases

Resistance fades

More often than not, five minutes turns into fifteen… then thirty… then completion.

3. It Reduces the Fear of “Forever”

We procrastinate because tasks feel endless:

“This workout will take an hour.”

“This blog post will take all evening.”

“This project will never end.”

Five minutes reframes the task as temporary.
Your brain relaxes — and lets you begin.
