If you’ve ever procrastinated on something important, writing, working out, cleaning, learning a new skill and want to find the one stupid simple hack to make doing all these things painless, I've got a hack for you.

One of the simplest productivity ideas I’ve come across is the 5 minute rule. It’s deceptively simple, but incredibly powerful when applied consistently.

The rule is:
> Commit to doing a task for just five minutes. That’s it.

Not forever.
Not “until it’s done.”
Just five minutes.

If after five minutes you want to stop, you’re allowed to stop, guilt free.  
The magic isn’t in the five minutes themselves.  
It’s in what happens after you start.  
## Why the 5-Minute Rule Works
### Starting Is the Hardest Part
Most tasks don’t feel hard once you’re doing them.
They feel hard before you start.
Your brain exaggerates:
- The effort required
- The time commitment
- The emotional cost
Five minutes feels safe. Non-threatening. Manageable.
### It Bypasses Motivation
The 5-Minute Rule doesn’t rely on motivation.
It relies on momentum.
Once you start:
- Friction drops
- Focus increases
- Resistance fades
More often than not, 5 minutes turns into 15… then 30… then completion.
### It Reduces the Fear of “Forever”
We procrastinate because tasks feel endless:
- “This workout will take an hour.”
- “This blog post will take all evening.”
- “This project will never end.”
Five minutes reframes the task as temporary.
Your brain relaxes — and lets you begin.
